> Abstract data types, commonly abbreviated ADTs, are a way of classifying data structures based on how they are used and the behaviors they provide. They do not specify how the data structure must be implemented but simply provide a minimal expected interface and set of behaviors.

> Data Structure is a concrete implementation of a data type. It’s possible to analyze the time and memory complexity of a Data Structure but not from a data type. The Data Structure can be implemented in several ways and its implementation may vary from language to language.
